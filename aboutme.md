My name is Xinyu Zhou(周鑫宇). 

Research Interests: TO BE CONTINUED...



### Something about me

​    Currently, I am a senior undergraduate student at Southern University of Science and Technology (Sustech) in China and my major is Computer Science. In addition, I am an incoming first-year PhD at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore under the supervision of Prof. ZHAO Jun.

   When I was a junior undergraduate student, I joined Prof. Hisao Ishibuchi's group and did research about multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. Then, during that summer, I went to UC Irvine and became a research assistant in Prof. Amir AghaKouchak's group for two months. I translated a global heatwave and warm-spell toolbox from MATLAB into Python.
